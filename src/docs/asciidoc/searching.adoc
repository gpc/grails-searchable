= Searching

If you've outgrown the simple link:index.html#_searchablecontroller_and_view[controller and view], you need the search API.

The plugin provides search methods with its SearchableService and also adds some to your _searchable_ domain classes.
The available methods are the same but the domain class methods restrict the search space to only that class (or hierarchy).

The methods are:

* *link:index.html#_searching[search]* - Find objects matching a query
* *link:index.html#_counthits[countHits]* - Find the number of hits for a query
* *link:index.html#_morelikethis[moreLikeThis]* - Finds similar objects to the indicated searchable domain class instance
* *link:index.html#_suggestquery[suggestQuery]* - Suggest a new search query based on spelling
* *link:index.html#_termfreqs[termFreqs]* - Returns term frequencies for the terms in the index
